# Usage:
Click each of the buttons next to the bold text in the Configuration area to set their values.  
Each property excluding the map file gets saved to a file called hbcsettings.txt in the same directory with a KEY=VALUE\n format.  
Pick the options you need in the Configuration area, pick the amount of threads and then press Compile. You can forcefully stop the compile if it takes too long.  
Once the compiling is finished, depending on your choice it'll start the Source game you're compiling for in the finished map.
